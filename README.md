# Swift Find

ðŸš€ **Beta Release** ðŸš€

This project is currently in **beta**, and I am actively working on the **Settings Page**. Please note that the **Auto Start** function does not work automatically yet, so manual setup is required for running on startup.

## Features & Usage

- To open the **Settings**, type `/help` in the prompt.
- **Bang Support**: The project supports "bangs" similar to DuckDuckGo. However, instead of the conventional `!bang` format, you can use `.bang` (e.g., `.g` for Google search).
- **Custom Flags**: I am working on implementing custom flags for enhanced functionality.

## Running on Startup (Windows)

To run the app on startup manually in Windows:

1. Create a shortcut of the application.
2. Open the **Run** window by pressing `Win + R`.
3. Type `shell:startup` and hit **Enter**.
4. Paste the shortcut inside the folder that opens.

This will ensure the application runs on startup until the Auto Start feature is fully functional.
